This project is a Machine Learning-based system designed to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and more. The model leverages historical housing data to provide accurate price predictions, helping buyers, sellers, and real estate agents make informed decisions.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares raw housing data for analysis.
Model Training: Implements regression algorithms to predict prices.
User Interface (Optional): A simple interface to input property details and get predictions.
Scalable: Easily extendable with more features or datasets.
